## Dear TRG

### To start container use
```
docker compose up
```
It's starting about 2 minutes, keep patient.

### Postman API
```

```

This is test task, so I use one mongoDB database for all 
collections we needed. I understand that microservices usually
use one DB for one microservice. Also, for saving time, I 
decided to use Mongoose ODM, but it's not the best choice 
for production, because ORMs and ODMs are weak when we need 
to make advanced DB requests.

I understand, that this realization could be more abstract, 
but time is limited.

It was an interesting project, and I hope that this test task 
shows my code style well.

Best regards,
Vladimir Traigel
